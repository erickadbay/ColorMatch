Description:
Tap the matching circle according to the Stroop or a Card in the center.
Match as many as you can before the time runs out. You will get a 1 second bonus per 3 correct answers to help.
Matching correct answers in series will fill your multiplier bar. Once full, you'll be able to get maximum points.
Keep track of your Stroops/Cards per second to compare your skill with friends.
